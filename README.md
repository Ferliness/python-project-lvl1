## Description:
This project contains five console games: 
brain-calc, brain-even, brain-gcd, brain-prime, brain-progression.
All these games generate a random number/numbers and expect an answer to the game's question. 
The game will end with a victory after three correct answers.
Any mistake will be considered a defeat. 
Good luck!
